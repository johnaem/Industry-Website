      <h2>About the Industry</h2>
      <p>The advertising and digital media industry centers on creating, distributing, and optimizing messages that connect brands 
        with audiences. It blends creativity, analytics, and technology to produce campaigns across channels — including social media, 
        display ads, video, search, podcasts, and experiential installations. Agencies in this industry provide strategy, creative 
        direction, production, media buying, and measurement services to help clients build awareness, drive engagement, and achieve 
        business goals.</p>

      <h2>My Role: Creative / Digital Technologist</h2>
      <p>As a Creative / Digital Technologist, I act as the technical partner to creative teams: I prototype interactive concepts, 
        build web and app experiences, integrate emerging tech (AR/VR, AI-based personalization), and ensure campaigns are technically 
        feasible and performant. I translate artistic vision into functioning digital products, optimize user experiences, and collaborate 
        across design, engineering, and strategy to deliver measurable campaign outcomes.</p>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Potential Ethical Issue</h2>
      <p>An ethical concern that can arise in this role is the misuse of persuasive technology. For example, designing hyper-targeted 
        creative that exploits vulnerable audiences or manipulates emotions in ways that undermine informed consent raises moral questions. 
        As a technologist, it’s important to balance persuasive effectiveness with respect for user autonomy, transparent data use, and 
        client responsibility.</p>

      <h2>Cybersecurity Issues that Could Arise</h2>
      <p><strong>1. Data Breaches and Client Data Exposure:</strong> Advertising campaigns often rely on sensitive customer data 
        (CRM records, user identifiers, audience segments). A breach or improper third-party integration could leak PII or targeting data, 
        harming customers and damaging client trust.</p>
      <p><strong>2. Supply-Chain & Ad Tech Vulnerabilities:</strong> Modern ad stacks use many third-party tags, SDKs, and programmatic partners. 
        Malicious or compromised ad-tech vendors can inject malware (malvertising), redirect traffic, or manipulate creative, causing brand safety 
        incidents and security risks for end-users.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Cybersecurity Best Practices for the Industry</h2>
      <p><strong>Vendor vetting & supply-chain controls:</strong> Conduct security assessments of ad-tech vendors and limit third-party tags. 
        Use tag management to control and monitor scripts that run on campaign properties.</p>
      <p><strong>Data governance & minimization:</strong> Collect only what you need, encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit, and enforce 
        least-privilege access for campaign teams.</p>
      <p><strong>Secure development & testing:</strong> Follow secure coding practices, perform vulnerability scanning and penetration testing 
        on campaign sites/apps, and validate media creatives for malicious content before launch.</p>
      <p><strong>Incident response & monitoring:</strong> Maintain logging, set up alerting for unusual activity, and have a clear breach 
        response plan that includes client notification and remediation steps.</p>
