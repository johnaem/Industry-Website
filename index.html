    <div class="value-word honesty">
        <h2>Honesty</h2>
        
        <p> It is important to me that people are honest and tell the truth. 
            Being honest means telling the truth and being truthfull about things you have done or said.
        I love to be surrounded by honest people because I know that I can trust them with things that I 
    tell them and they can trust me with things they tell me. When myself or others aren't honest, no one can be trusted.
  And when someone doesn't trust you, it's hard to get that trust back.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="value-word balance">
        <h2>Balance</h2>
        <p>Having a balance is important. When things are balanced it, it works out perfectly for me.
            And along with being balanced, organized also falls into that catergory. When things are balanced 
            and organized I am at peace the most and everything runs smoothly. I can't put my main focus on one thing because it makes me off-balance. Whenever I am off balance, I can't get things done as smoothly as 
            I would like. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="value-word friendship">
        <h2>Friendship</h2>
        <p>Friendship is very important to me because of many reasons. I believe that my friends are the people
            who have made me into the person I am today. They are also the people I can go to for help and advice. 
            They are the ones that stuck with me through hard and trying times. I value all of my friendships even 
            with the friends I don't see everyday. I can't go a day without speaking to my friends because they are a 
            part of me.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="value-word personal-growth">
        <h2>Personal Growth</h2>
        <p>Personal growth is very important for me. I like to grow as a person. I know that I can always grow as a 
            person. Everyone has room for growth because everyone isn't perfect. I try to grow in ways that will beneifit
            me in the long run. I thrive to be the best person I can be and also to be a role model for the younger 
            generations coming up. If I don't see growth in myself, then I need to re-evaluate myself. You never want to settle
            for your basic self, it's best to always grow and improve.
